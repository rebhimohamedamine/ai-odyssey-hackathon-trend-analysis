## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the **AI Odyssey Hackathon**, focusing on analyzing trends from Twitter data. The goal is to provide a user-friendly dashboard that visualizes key insights, such as popular hashtags, trending topics, and sentiment analysis. The dashboard is built using **Dash**, a Python framework for building analytical web applications, and **Plotly** for interactive visualizations.
